Using it requires holding the Tesla Ray in the main hand, and a charged $(l:alchemy/forge_energy#leyden_jar)Leyden Jar$() in the offhand. The Tesla Ray has a cooldown period, just like the attack cooldown on a sword. Using it during its cooldown is very ineffective. "

It oly arcs at all if fired when not on cooldown, and it won't fire unless there's an enemy to hit. Every shot of the Ray drains some charge from the $(l:alchemy/forge_energy#leyden_jar)Leyden Jar$(). Producing the Tesla Ray requires a material from Technomancy ($(l:technomancy/ccc)Copshowium)."

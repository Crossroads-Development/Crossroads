It cannot be smelted in a normal furnace. The ore must be melted down in a $(l:heat/heating_crucible)Heating Crucible$() into molten copper.$(br2)Then, molten copper must be run through a $(l:heat/fluid_cooling_chamber)Fluid Cooling Chamber$() to cool it into ingots. When all's said and done, one copper ore will be enough for one copper ingot."

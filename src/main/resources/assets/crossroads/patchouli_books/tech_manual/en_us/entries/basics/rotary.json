There are small gears which take up a single blockspace and large gears which take up a 3x3 area. 6 small gears can fit in one blockspace, one on each side. Small gears require something solid to attach to. They can connect around corners and to adjacent gears. "

They connect in the same way small gears do. Axles connect two things together axially, for example connecting a small gear on one end to a large gear, a machine, or another axle on the other end.$(br2)Most (but not all) rotary machines have an internal gear that must be connected to axially."

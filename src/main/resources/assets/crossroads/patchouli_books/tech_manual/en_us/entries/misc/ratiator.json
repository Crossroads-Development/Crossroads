Instead of comparing two values or subtracting them, it multiplies and divides. Its two modes (changed with a right click) are multiplication and division. The symbol on the plate changes based on the mode. "

The moment it outputs to redstone, however, it rounds down to an integer and caps it at 15. To take advantage of the ability to use other values, Ratiators can take input from another Ratiator directly, avoiding capping and rounding. It can measure things behind it like a comparator. "

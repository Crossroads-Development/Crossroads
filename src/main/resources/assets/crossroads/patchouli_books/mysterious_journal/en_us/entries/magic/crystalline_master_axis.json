It can accept magical beams and alter its behavior based on the element. It can only have the effect from one element active at a time. Every time it receives a beam (limit one beam/side/5 ticks), it acts differently based on the element for the next (beam power * 5) ticks. "

Each time it receives an element different from the previous one, it resets the timer and switches to the new element. Not all elements have an effect, but for example $(energy)energy$() increases the total energy of the gear system by 10/tick if there is any energy to begin with, and $(equalibrium)equalibrium$() decreases the change in energy each tick by 75%.

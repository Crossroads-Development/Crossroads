Only one can be fit into a blockspace, and it can only be placed on the ground, not walls or ceilings. It doesn't need to be on a solid block, however. A comparator can also be used to measure the energy of a Toggle Gear. "

Even if a Toggle Gear does not have a redstone signal, it can still interact with Axles or an attached Master Axis."

To create void beams, fire a beam of RIFT through a Lens Holder containing a Void Crystal. This will emit a beam of pure void, of the same power as the Rift beam.

Usually the new effect is the opposite of the original effect, though not always. You have to work out the exact effects on your own, but they are usually pretty easy to guess. For example, VOID-$(energy)ENERGY$() cools things down instead of heating them up, while VOID-$(stability)STABILITY$() makes explosions based on the power of the beam. "

The Rotary Drill doesn't use any extra power when doing work. For breaking blocks, it requires a speed of at least .1 times the hardness of the block. For example, cobblestone has a hardness of 3, so a speed of .3 is required. Obsidian on the other hand has a hardness of 50, so to break obsidian the drill has a minimum speed of 5."

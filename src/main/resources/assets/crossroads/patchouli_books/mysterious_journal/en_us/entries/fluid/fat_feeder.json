Both gears need a non-zero speed. The radius of the Fat Feeder's operation is equal to ((top gear speed) / (bottom gear speed)), rounded down. The direction of the two gears does not matter. "

As with other machines, #fat_per_value#mB of fat equals 1 value. For every value that the Fat Feeder feeds to nearby players, 1 energy will be moved from the top gear to the bottom gear, always in the direction to decrease the top gear's speed and increase the bottom gear's speed."

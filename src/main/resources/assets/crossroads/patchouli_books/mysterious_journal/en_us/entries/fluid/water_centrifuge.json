The red ports output distilled water, and the orange ports accept water. Salt can be removed from the bottom. A gear needs to be on top of it. The Water Centrifuge itself takes no energy to run, however it still has requirements. "

Basically, the direction of the gear on top needs to keep reversing, and each time it needs to reach a speed of at least .5. One batch uses 100mB of water, and produces 100mB of distilled water and one unit of salt."

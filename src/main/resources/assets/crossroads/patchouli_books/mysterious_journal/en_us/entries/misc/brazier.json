Adding some water with a bucket makes it safe to land on the Brazier from a high height, and makes it extinguish you if you stand on it. Adding lava instead makes it set things on it on fire, so it can be used as a trash can for items that won't set the area on fire."

More interesting than the other effects though is that if you put a block of salt in it, it prevents the spawning of witches in a large area. It has a radius of #brazier_range# blocks."

The biggest difference is that instead of extending 1 block, it extends the number of blocks equal to the strength of the redstone signal it is receiving (up to 15 blocks). It also can push up to 64 blocks at a time instead of 12, and it extends and retracts instantly. "

            "text": "When pushing entities with slime blocks, pushing farther at once multiplies the effect. The Multi-Piston also doesn't have quasi-connectivity. To make up for this, the Multi-Piston can have redstone placed on top of it directly. The Multi-Piston has a normal and sticky variant. There is also a simpler recipe for normal pistons that is shapeless."

By attaching it to a block such as a chest, and orientating the Port Extender so the gray square on the front is going into the block, anything attached to the Port Extender will act as if it is connected to the block itself."

Note that this connection is one-way, that Port Extenders cannot be chained, and that this only works for item transfer, not any other type of connection (such as fluid)."

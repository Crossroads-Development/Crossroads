It needs a Redstone Input port on the South side and a Rotary port on the Up side, which will connect to a single internal gear of I=10. When the pistol isn't fully loaded, shift-right click with it to load an iron nugget from your inventory. It has a magazine size of 6. "

As there is no upper limit on speed, depending on design quality a bullet might do no damage or 1-shot the enderdragon. While the right-mouse is held, the South Redstone In port will have a signal strength of 2, or if the player is sneaking, 1, when read by Ratiator."

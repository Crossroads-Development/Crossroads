			"text": "$(item)Multi-Pistons/$ are uber-pistons that can extend up to 15 blocks, can push 64 blocks at a time, and extend instantly. They extend a distance equal to the redstone signal strength, and have a sticky variant. When pushing entities with a slime block, the bouncing effect is increased the farther they push, letting them launch mobs or players huge distances."

The <item>Chemical Vent/$ is an automated way of releasing <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ into the world to perform <thing><link:essentials:alchemy/effect>effects/$. Any received <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ will be released into the world at the <item>vent/$.
If multiple sets of <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ are inserted within 1 second of each other, they will be combined before release. This is significant for things like the range of liquids/gasses, or for blending <thing><link:essentials:alchemy/effect>effects/$ for a flame cloud. As a <item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>conduit/$ can only transfer 5 units per tick, 1 second means it can group up to 100 units of <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$.
<item>Chemical vents/$ can handle <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ that normally need to be contained in crystal safely.

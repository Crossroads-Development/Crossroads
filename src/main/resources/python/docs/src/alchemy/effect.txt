Reagent Effects
crossroads:shell_glass|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
Most <thing>reagents/$ (but not all) have an <thing>effect/$ when released into the world. Unlike <thing><link:intro/beams>beam effects/$ which get more powerful as power/quantity increases, all <thing>reagent effects/$ will stay the same strength at all quantities. Instead, as quantity increases, the distance the <thing>effect/$ spreads increases.
Easy ways to release <thing>reagents/$ are by <link:alchemy/glassware>pouring out a Phial, throwing a Shell/$, or <link:alchemy/vent>piping out a Chemical Vent/$.

Different <thing><link:intro/alchemy>phases/$ of matter will make the <thing>effects/$ spread differently.
<thing>Solids/$ will apply only at the position they were released. If there is <em>any/$ <thing>liquid/$ being released, all <thing>solid reagents/$ will have their effects apply everywhere the <thing>liquids/$ spray- allowing even 1 unit of <thing>solid/$ reagent to apply over a large area if mixed with <thing>liquid/$, like <thing>liquid/$ water.
<thing>Liquids/$ will splash out over a small area- the splash radius is <thing>total liquid qty/$ / 8, capped at 3 blocks. All <thing>liquids/$ will splash together, and will apply their <thing>effects/$ along with the <thing>effects/$ of any <thing>solids/$ in the mix.
<thing>Gasses/$ will spread out over a medium area- the splash radius is <thing>total gas qty/$ / 3, capped at 8 blocks. All <thing>gasses/$ will spread together, applying their <thing>effects/$ over the entire volume. However, <thing>gasses/$ <em>will not apply/$ any <thing>liquid/$ or <thing>solid/$ <thing>effects/$ over the affected volume.
<thing>Flame/$ is a special <thing>phase/$ which only applies to two reagents- <item>Phelostogen/$ and <item>Ignis Infernum/$- both of which are always <thing>flame phase/$ regardless of temperature. When a <thing>flame reagent/$ is released, it will spread over an extremely large area: Radius is <thing>phelostogen qty/$ / 2 (cap 8 blocks) or <thing>ignis infernum qty/$ * 4 (cap <em>64/$ blocks). This means the range caps out at 16 units of <thing>flame/$ reagent. Any and all <thing>reagents/$ will have their <thing>effects/$ applied over the entire area. Pure <thing>flame reagents/$ will destroy any blocks they touch- <em>unless there is any <item>alchemical salt/$<em> in the mix/$. That means any <thing>effect/$ can be spread out over a massive area using 16 of a <thing>flame reagent/$, 1 unit of <item>alchemical salt/$ to prevent destroying blocks, and the <thing>reagents/$ you want applied.

The following useful effects exist:
<item>Aqua Regia, Acids:/$ See the <link:alchemy/acid>acids page/$. Allows getting <item>bedrock dust/$.
<item>Salt and Alchemical Salt:/$ Kill plants, creepers, and slimes like a <item><link:fluid/ingr>Salt Block/$ does.
<item>Chlorine:/$ Apply a massive number of crippling debuffs to any entities. Wither, slowness, weakness, blindness, and others- the quintessential chemical weapon.
<item>Sulfur Dioxide:/$ Cures Zombie Villagers. Also cures poison and hunger.
<item>Phelostogen and Ignis Infernum:/$ Destroys all blocks and sets fires, unless there is any (even 1) <item>alchemical salt/$ in the mix being released. Locked to <thing>flame phase/$, spreading <thing>effects/$ over a massive area (see above).
<item>Aether, Lumen, Eldrine, Fusas, and Stasisol:/$ See the <link:alchemy/terraforming>Terraforming entry/$.
<item>Voltus:/$ Electrocutes any nearby entities with lightning arcs (10 damage per hit, may hit several times). Can charge creepers/pigs/etc. Combine with a <thing>flame phase/$ for an expanding cloud of electric death.

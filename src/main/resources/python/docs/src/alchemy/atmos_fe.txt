Atmospheric Attenuator
crossroads:atmos_charger|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
The <item>Atmospheric Attenuator/$ is a way of wirelessly transmitting FE globally and sharing it with other players. There is no range limit or FE loss. In order to function, there must be a pillar of 4 iron bars (vanilla block) over the <item>atmospheric attenuator/$.
There is a global shared <thing>'atmospheric' storage/$ of FE with a (default) capacity of 1,000,000,000FE (1 billion FE). All players share the <thing>atmospheric FE/$, and there is no way of 'cutting off' other players from the shared <thing>atmosphere pool/$.
The <item>atmospheric attenuator/$ has two modes (toggle by shift-right-clicking with a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$) to charge the <thing>atmosphere/$ with FE or drain FE from the <thing>atmosphere/$. One <item>atmospheric attenuator/$ can drain/charge a maximum of 20,000FE/t.
However, if the <thing>atmospheric storage/$ gets too full, there will be global consequences. Above 50% full, lightning strikes will become more common, and can occur even during clear weather. Above 90% full, any creepers that spawn will spawn as charged creepers. <em>It would be a good idea to setup a system to prevent the charge from getting too high!/$
<thing><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ will measure the percentage fullness of the shared <thing>atmospheric storage/$- reading from 0 to 100.

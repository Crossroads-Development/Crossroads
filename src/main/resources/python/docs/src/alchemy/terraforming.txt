Terraforming
minecraft:grass_block|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
There are several <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ which have <thing><link:crossroads:alchemy/effect>effects/$ that change the biome and transmute blocks.
By combining one of these <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ with <link:crossroads:alchemy/stones><item>phelostogen/$ or <link:crossroads:alchemy/stones><item>ignis infernum/$, the <thing><link:crossroads:alchemy/effect>effect/$ can be spread over a large area by the <thing><link:crossroads:alchemy/effect>flame cloud/$ for terraforming.

<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Aether:/$ will set the biome to plains, will turn soil materials to grass blocks, will turn rock materials to stone, will turn 'crystal' blocks to glass, turns trees to oak, and will turn liquids to water. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Aether/$ is basically a normal overworld-plains terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with dirt.
<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Magicae:/$ will set the biome to mushroom island, will turn soil materials to mycelium, will turn rock materials to stone, will turn 'crystal' blocks to shroomlight, turns trees into giant mushrooms, and will turn liquids to water. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Magicae/$ is basically a mushroom terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with dirt.
<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Eldrine:/$ will set the biome to hell, will turn soil materials to soul soil, will turn rock materials to netherrack, will turn 'crystal' blocks to glowstone, turns trees to crimson trees, and will turn liquids to lava. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Eldrine/$ is basically a nether terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with soulsand.
<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Fusas:/$ will set the biome to deep ocean, will turn soil materials to clay, will turn rock materials to prismarine, will turn 'crystal' blocks to sea lanterns, turns trees into coral, and will turn liquids to distilled water. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Fusas/$ is basically an ocean-temple terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with clay.
<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Lumen:/$ will set the biome to desert, will turn soil materials to sand, will turn rock materials to sandstone, will turn 'crystal' blocks to <item><link:crossroads:fluid/ingr>salt blocks/$, turns trees into bone, and will remove liquids. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Lumen/$ is basically a desert terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with sand.
<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Stasisol:/$ will set the biome to snowy tundra, will turn soil materials to snow, will turn rock materials to packed ice, will turn 'crystal' blocks to blue ice, turns trees into spruce, and will turn liquids to ice. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Stasisol/$ is basically a snow terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with snow.
<item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Expandus:/$ will set the biome to flower forest, will turn soil materials to grass blocks, will turn rock materials to stone, will turn 'crystal' blocks to honey blocks, turns trees to oak, and will turn liquids to water. <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>Expandus/$ is basically a normal flower forest terraformer. When mixed with <item>quicksilver/$, it will fill empty space with dirt.

If any <item>quicksilver/$ is present in the released mix, then the <thing><link:crossroads:alchemy/effect>effect/$ will be changed- in addition to changing the biome and transmuting blocks, air will be filled in with certain blocks- allowing filling in massive areas.
If any <item>sulfur dioxide/$ is present in the released mix, then biomes will not be changed, but blocks will still be transmuted.
If any <item>cavorite/$ is present in the released mix, then blocks will not be transmuted, but biomes will still be changed.

The 'ideal mix' for terraforming is 1 unit of the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>reagent/$ used for terraforming, 1 unit of <item>alchemical salt/$ to prevent <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>phelostogen/$ / <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>ignis infernum/$ from destroying blocks, optionally 1 unit of <item>quicksilver/$, <item>sulfur dioxide/$, or <item>cavorite/$ (for modifications of the effect), and as much <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>phelostogen/$ / <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/stones>ignis infernum/$ as desired to make the effect apply over a large area.
For such a large and complicated mix being released, it is suggested to release it using a <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/glassware>shell/$ or <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/glassware>phial/$.

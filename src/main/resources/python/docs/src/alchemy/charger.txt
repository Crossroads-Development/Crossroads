The <item>Electrolyzer/$ is a way of allowing <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ to occur in <item><link:essentials:alchemy/glassware>manual glassware/$ in a charged environment. It acts like a more expensive <item><link:essentials:alchemy/glassware>glassware stand/$ that accepts FE (Forge Energy) on all sides. It will drain 10FE/t, regardless of whether it is active, and any <item><link:essentials:alchemy/glassware>florence flask/$ placed inside will allow <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ that need a charged environment (these <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ are shown by a lightning bolt symbol in the JEI recipe page).
It drains 10FE/t at all times, and has a capacity of 100FE. Dispensers can place and remove <item><link:essentials:alchemy/glassware>glassware/$ from the <item>electrolyzer/$ the same way as with a <item><link:essentials:alchemy/glassware#stand>glassware stand/$.

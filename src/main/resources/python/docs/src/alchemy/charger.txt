Electrolyzer
crossroads:charging_stand|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
The <item>Electrolyzer/$ is a way of allowing <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ to occur in <item><link:alchemy/glassware>manual glassware/$ in a charged environment. It acts like a more expensive <item><link:alchemy/glassware>glassware stand/$ that accepts FE (Forge Energy) on all sides. It will drain 10FE/t, regardless of whether it is active, and any <item><link:alchemy/glassware>florence flask/$ placed inside will allow <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ that need a charged environment (these <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ are shown by a lightning bolt symbol in the JEI recipe page).
It drains 10FE/t at all times, and has a capacity of 100FE. Like the <item><link:alchemy/glassware>glassware stand/$, <item><link:heat/cable>heat cables/$ can connect to the bottom if it contains a <item><link:alchemy/glassware>florence flask/$, but unlike the <item><link:alchemy/glassware>glassware stand/$, it will <em>never connect on the top to a <item><link:alchemy/conduit>alchemy conduit/$.

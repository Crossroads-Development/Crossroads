Acids & Aqua Regia
crossroads:solid_regia|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
<thing>Alchemy/$ adds four different reagents that are acids: <item>Sulfuric Acid/$, <item>Muriatic Acid/$, <item>Aziotic Acid/$, and <item>Aqua Regia/$. Three of these (Sulfuric, Muriatic, and Aziotic) act identically. <item>Aqua Regia/$ is more powerful than the other three, and allows <em>breaking bedrock/$ and getting <item>Bedrock Dust/$.
The three normal acids have the same <thing><link:alchemy/effect>effect/$: They deal 8 damage to any entity they hit, and will break metal blocks other than gold.

<item>Aqua Regia/$ will do 12 damage to hit entities, and will break metal blocks (including gold). Much more importantly, any bedrock that <item>aqua regia/$ hits will be broken, dropping 1 <item>Bedrock Dust/$, an important reagent.
As <thing>aqua regia/$ can be expensive and you will need a lot of <item>bedrock dust/$, it suggested to mix it with a cheap liquid (like water) to splash the <thing><link:alchemy/effect>effect/$ over a large area. See the <thing><link:alchemy/effect>effects/$ page for full details.

Thermal Conduit
crossroads:heated_tube|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
The <item>Thermal Conduit/$ is a way of heating or cooling <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ flowing through <item><link:alchemy/conduit>conduits/$. Another way to do this is by using a <item><link:alchemy/vessel>reaction vessel/$.
They input <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ on one side, and output on the opposite side. They cannot face vertically, and have both a glass and crystal variant. A <item><link:heat/cable>heat cable/$ can connect to the top/bottom.
Any <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ flowing through the tube will have the temperature set to that of the attached <item><link:heat/cable>heat cable/$. This will change the temperature of the <item><link:heat/cable>heat cable/$ towards the temperature of the <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$, so it may be necessary to have multiple <item>thermal conduits/$ in series if there is a high throughput.

Philosopher's & Practitioner's Stone
crossroads:phil_stone|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
The <item>Philosopher's Stone/$ and <item>Practitioner's Stone/$ are important items/<thing>reagents/$ which are used as <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>catalysts/$ in some important reactions.
The <item>philosopher's stone/$ can be considered to unlock 'tier 2 alchemy'. The <item>practitioner's stone/$ can be considered to unlock 'tier 3 alchemy'.

The <item>Philosopher's Stone/$ is used to make <item>Phelostogen/$, <item>Aether/$, and <thing>Adamant/$, which are three very important <thing>reagents/$ which many features are locked behind. The <item>philosopher's stone/$, <item>phelostogen/$, and <item>aether/$ need to be contained in crystal glassware- they will destroy glass. Before making the <item>stone/$, make sure to be doing the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>reaction/$ in crystal glassware.

The <item>Practitioner's Stone/$ is used to make several special <thing>elemental reagents/$: <item>Eldrine/$, <item>Fusas/$, <item>Lumen/$, <item>Stasisol/$, and <item>Voltus/$. All of these must be contained in crystal (along with the <item>stone/$ itself). The <thing>reactions/$ to make these <thing>elemental reagents/$ are NOT in JEI, because they are not normal <thing>reactions/$.
To make an <thing>elemental reagent/$, there must be a <item>practitioner's stone/$ as <thing>catalyst/$, the glassware must be <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>charged/$, and <item>phelostogen/$, <item>aether/$, and <item>adamant/$ must be present in the right proportions. The amount of <thing>elemental reagent/$ made is equal to the total qty of the ingredients used.
The correct proportions for the ingredients is not fixed- unlike a normal <thing><link:crossroads:intro/alchemy>reaction/$. Each <thing>elemental reagent/$ is associated with a <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam alignment/$; <item>eldrine/$ is <thing>rift/$; <item>fusas/$ is <thing>fusion/$; <item>lumen/$ is <thing>light/$; <item>stasisol/$ is <thing>equilibrium/$; <item>voltus/$ is <thing>charge/$.
If <item>phelostogen/$ is considered <thing>energy/$, <item>aether/$ is considered <thing>potential/$, and <item>adamant/$ is <thing>stability/$, combine the three in a ratio such that it would make the <thing>beam alignment/$ that goes with the <thing>elemental reagent/$ you want.
For example, 1:1:0 of <item>phelostogen/$:<item>aether/$:<item>adamant/$ will make <item>voltus/$, but so will 4:3:0.

The main use of the <thing>elemental reagents/$ made with a <item>practitioner's stone/$ is their effects. See the <link:crossroads:alchemy/terraforming>terraforming entry/$ for more.
<item>Voltus/$ can also be used as an FE source in a <item><link:crossroads:alchemy/generator>Voltus Generator/$, or used to deal damage (see the <link:crossroads:alchemy/effect>effects page/$ for details).

Fluid Injector
crossroads:fluid_injector|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
The <item>Fluid Injector/$ is an automated way to convert between fluids and liquid-phase <thing><link:intro/alchemy>alchemy reagents/$. It connects to a fluid pipe on the top and a <item><link:alchemy/conduit>alchemy conduit/$ on the bottom. It can convert in either direction, and 1 unit of <thing><link:intro/alchemy>alchemy reagent/$ is worth more than 1mB of fluid. Added <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ will be added at a temperature it would be liquid at.

Only certain <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ and fluids can be converted- most <thing><link:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ have no liquid associated with it.

Density Plate
crossroads:densus_plate|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
<item>Density Plates/$ allow manipulating gravity. They have two variants: <item>Density Plates/$ and <item>Anti-Density Plates/$.
They can face in any direction, and will pull (for <item>density plates/$) or push (for <item>anti-density plates/$) entities in front with a (default) range of 64 blocks. Entities are pushed/pulled at an acceleration of 240 blocks/s² (gravity is 32 blocks/s²).
This effect stacks with multiple plates, and works through walls. One plate will easily overcome gravity if pulling up, and applies to all entity types.

A <item>Block of Cavorite/$ will block the effect of <item>density plates/$ from passing beyong it, and can be moved by pistons.

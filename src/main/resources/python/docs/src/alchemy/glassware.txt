When doing <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ manually (either because it's early on or you're only doing small batches), <item>glassware/$ is the most convenient method. The automated version is <item><link:essentials:alchemy/vessel>reaction vessels/$.
There are three types of <item>glassware/$: <item>Phials/$, <item>Florence Flasks/$, and <item>Shells/$. They can be placed onto a <item>Glassware Stand/$, which you will want several of. Each type of <item>glassware/$ has a glass and crystal variant (the crystal variant is for containing higher tier <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$).
<item>Glassware/$ can be placed onto a <item>stand/$ by right clicking with the <item>glassware/$. It can be removed- with all contents staying in the <item>glassware/$- by shift-right clicking with an empty hand. <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>Reagents/$ can be transferred between <item>glassware/$ on a <item>stand/$ and held <item>glassware/$ by right clicking with the <item>glassware/$. Items that are the solid for of a <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagent/$ can be added to <item>glassware/$ on a <item>stand/$ by right clicking the <item>stand/$ with the item. The item forms of solid <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ can be removed by right clicking with an empty hand. The liquid form of <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ can be added by right clicking with a bucket filled with the <link:essentials:alchemy/fluid_injector>corresponding liquid/$ (ex. distilled water bucket -> <item>water reagent/$). Liquid <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagent/$ can be removed with a bucket by right clicking with a bucket <em>if that reagent has a bucket form (most don't) and there is enough present).
<item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>Conduits/$ can connect to the top of the <item>stand/$ if there is <item>glassware/$ in it, allowing <item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>conduits/$ to interact with <item>glassware/$. If the <item>stand/$ has a redstone signal, it will force <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ upwards out through any connected <item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>conduits/$- even if it is in a phase that normally wouldn't flow up (like liquid).

<item>Phials/$ are used for storing and transferring <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$. They <em>will not/$ allow <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ to occur inside them. They have a capacity of 20, and are cheap to make. They can also be right-clicked in the world to pour out their <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$, emptying the <item>phial/$ and allowing the <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ to perform their <thing><link:essentials:alchemy/effect>effects/$.

<item>Florence Flasks/$ are used for heating/cooling <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ and performing <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$. While a <item>florence flask/$ it placed on a <item>stand/$, the stand will be able to connect to a <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>heat cable/$ on the bottom. This allows controlling the temperature of the contained <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ with a <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>cable/$. The <item>florence flask/$ will allow <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ to occur inside it. It has a capacity of 100. The <item>florence flask/$ can not be <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>charged/$ by a <item>stand/$- it you want to do <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$ manually in a <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>charged environment/$, use a <item><link:essentials:alchemy/charger>electrolyzer/$.

<item>Shells/$ are used for throwing <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ to use their <thing><link:essentials:alchemy/effect>effects/$ far away from the user. They act like <item>phials/$ while in a <item>stand/$ (capacity 20, no reactions), but can be thrown with a right click. They will shatter where they land, releasing their <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ to perform their <thing><link:essentials:alchemy/effect>effects/$. They can also be thrown by dispensors.

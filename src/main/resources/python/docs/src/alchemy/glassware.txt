<item>Glassware/$ is the bread-and-butter for moving <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ manually.
There are three types of <item>glassware/$: <item>Phials/$, <item>Florence Flasks/$, and <item>Shells/$. Each type of <item>glassware/$ has a glass and crystal variant (the crystal variant is for containing higher tier <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$).

<item>Phials/$ are the simplest and smallest <item>glassware/$. They can store <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$, and you can pour out the stored <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ into the world by right-clicking with the item.

<item>Shells/$ are like <item>phials/$, except they are thrown (like a snowball) and break open on impact, releasing the stored <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ into the world. They can also be thrown by dispensers.

<Item>Florence Flasks/$ are for <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$. The automated version is <item><link:essentials:alchemy/vessel>reaction vessels/$. Unlike <item>phials and shells/$, <item>florence flasks/$ allow <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reactions/$. They can also be connected to <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>heat cables/$ on the bottom side when placed on a <item>glassware stand/$.
<page|text|stand>
<item>Glassware/$ can be placed onto a <item>glassware stand/$ by right clicking with the <item>glassware/$. It can be removed by shift-right-clicking with an empty hand, and the contents stay in the <item>glassware/$ item.
<item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>Conduits/$ can connect to the top of the <item>stand/$ if there is <item>glassware/$ in it, allowing <item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>conduits/$ to interact with <item>glassware/$. Using a <item><link:essentials:wrench>wrench/$ on the <item>stand/$ will flip it upside-down, so that <item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>conduits/$ connect to the bottom and <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>heat cables/$ on the top instead.
<thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>Reagents/$ can be transferred between <item>glassware/$ on a <item>stand/$ and held <item>glassware/$ by right-clicking with the <item>glassware/$. Items that are the solid form of a <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagent/$ can be added to <item>glassware/$ on a <item>stand/$ by right-clicking the <item>stand/$ with the item. The item forms of solid <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ can be removed by right-clicking with an empty hand. The liquid form of <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ can be added by right clicking with a bucket filled with the <link:essentials:alchemy/fluid_injector>corresponding liquid/$ (ex. distilled water bucket -> <item>water reagent/$). Liquid <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagent/$ can be removed with a bucket by right clicking with a bucket <em>if that reagent has a bucket form (most don't) and there is enough present).
Dispensers can place <item>glassware/$ onto a stand, and a (totally empty) dispenser can take glassware off a stand.

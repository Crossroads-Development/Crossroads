Reagent Conduits

<item>Resonating Filters/$ are an expensive but 'easy' way to filter out mixtures of <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$. They are rarely required- mixed <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ can usually be separated as items or by taking advantage of different boiling points (<link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>gasses won't naturally flow down, and liquids and solids won't go up/$).
The <item>resonating filter/$ has a UI with a single slot for <link:essentials:alchemy/glassware><item>glassware/$; any types of <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ in the <link:essentials:alchemy/glassware><item>glassware/$ are 'matched' by the filter. <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>Reagents/$ are accepted in the top, and <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ that match the filter will be transferred out the side, while <thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>reagents/$ that don't match are transferred out the bottom into a connected <item><link:essentials:alchemy/conduit>conduit/$ or other alchemy container.

Temperature Regulator
crossroads:heat_limiter_basic|crossroads:progress/path/alchemy
The <item>Temperature Regulator/$ is a powerful tool for controlling <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$. It allows precisely controlling the <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$ of a <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>heat cable/$ and connected machines.
The <item>temperature regulator/$ connects to two <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>heat cables/$- on the front and back- with the front being the side with the red 'ring'.

The <item>temperature regulator/$ has two modes: Red mode and blue mode, which can be toggled by shift-right-clicking with a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$.
In red mode, heat will be moved from the input to the output up to the target <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$, but no hotter. It can not heat the front higher than the back. In effect, it heats the output up to a set <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$.
In blue mode, heat will be moved from the output to the input down to the target <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$, but no colder. It can not cool the front lower than the back. In effect, it cools the output down to a set <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$.

There are two variants of the <item>temperature regulator/$: The <item>Temperature Regulator/$ has the target <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$ in Celcius set via a UI, while the <item>Redstone Temperature Regulator/$ has the target <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>temperature/$ in Celcius set to the current <thing><link:essentials/circuit>circuit/$ input.

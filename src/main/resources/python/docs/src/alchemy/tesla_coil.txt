<thing><link:essentials:intro/alchemy>Alchemy/$ unlocks several upgraded <item><link:essentials:fluid/tesla>tesla coil tops/$, which can be used on top of a <item><link:essentials:fluid/tesla>tesla coil/$.
There are 5 variants. Some have slightly different stats, while 2 do something completely different from transferring FE.

The <item>Offensive Tesla Coil Head/$ does not transfer FE, and will instead attack entities within range with 5 electric damage. It will also attack players, including the owner.

The <item>Decorative Tesla Coil Head/$ does not transfer FE, and will instead drain FE to shoot decorative electric bolts around it.

The <item>Long-Range Tesla Coil Head/$ has a transfer range of 32 blocks.

The <item>Efficient Tesla Coil Head/$ has no FE loss from transfer.

The <item>High-Intensity Tesla Coil Head/$ will transfer 10,000FE per jolt, effectively having 10x the normal FE transfer rate. It will not work without a <item><link:essentials:fluid/tesla>leyden jar/$ installed in the <item><link:essentials:fluid/tesla>tesla coil/$.

Rotary Drill
crossroads:rotary_drill
<item>Rotary Drills/$ are <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>rotary powered/$ block breakers and damage dealers. They connect to an axle or gear on the back, and will break/attack things on the front.
<item>Rotary Drills/$ drain power constantly, regardless of whether they are doing anything.
When breaking blocks, the higher the block's hardness, the higher the required speed (.2rad/s per hardness). When attacking mobs, the higher the speed, the more damage dealt (5 damage per rad/s).

There is also a <item>golden rotary drill/$, which acts as a player kill when killing mobs, causing them to drop XP and player-only loot, but has a higher power drain.

Industrial Blast Furnace
crossroads:blast_furnace
The <item>Industrial Blast Furnace/$ is part of the process to <em>triple/$ ores. It produces molten metal that can be cooled into ingots in a <item><link:heat/fcc>fluid cooling chamber/$. It consumes <item>metal gravel/$ made in a <item><link:rotary/stamp>stamp mill/$ or <item>metal clumps/$ made in an <item><link:fluid/cleanser>ore cleanser/$.
The <item>Industrial Blast Furnace/$ also uses carbon to run, in the form of either coal or charcoal- simply insert 1 coal or charcoal to get 16 carbon units. Every unit of carbon consumed will produce 1 <item>slag/$ as a byproduct- which has a few crafting uses. Processing <item>metal gravel/$ takes 2 carbon, while processing <item>metal clumps/$ only takes 1- so it may be worth adding an <item><link:fluid/cleanser>ore cleanser/$ to your ore processing line if coal/charcoal is running short.

The <item>Industrial Blast Furnace/$ uses <thing><link:intro/rotary>rotary power/$ to run. An axle/gear can connect to the top, and the machine has a minimum speed of 2.5rad/s.

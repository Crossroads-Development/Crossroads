The <item>Wind Turbine/$ is a renewable way to generate <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>rotary power/$ at a low <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>speed/$.
The <item>wind turbine/$ requires a 5x5 empty space in front of it, and the ability for its blades to see the sky. As long as these conditions are met, it will produce a random amount of power based on the wind- anywhere between 5J/t and 25J/t, producing 15J/t on average. All wind turbines in the world produce the same power at any given moment. The only issue is that <em>the wind doesn't always blow the same direction/$. The direction the <item>wind turbine/$ tries to turn will randomly swap- which may mean it's fighting against energy stored in a rotary system due to momentum.
The <item>wind turbine/$ will also stop producing power at speeds above 2rad/s- the wind is never that fast.
The axle connection is on the back. The wool blades can be dyed individually by using dye on the <item>Wind Turbine/$ block. 

<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuit Readers/$ will read the current power output; positive if the <item>wind turbine/$ is producing power in the positive direction (counter-clockwise), - if it is producing power in the negative direction (clockwise).
That means if a <thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuit Readers/$ reads below 0, the <item>wind turbine/$ is producing power in the negative direction. Combining this with things like <item><link:essentials:rotary/gear_base>toggle gears & clutches/$ makes it possible to ensure your turbine is <em>never/$ fighting momentum. <em>This is probably a good idea!/$

Spring Winding Stand
crossroads:winding_table
The <item>Spring Winding Stand/$- that's 'wind' as in winding a watch, not as in weather- allows winding up <link:rotary/crossbow>certain items/$ to charge them.
In order to wind an item inside the <item>Stand/$, the <item>Spring Winding Stand/$ needs an <thing><link:intro/rotary>axle connection/$ on the top, and needs a redstone pulse. Every time it receives a pulse, the <thing>spring speed/$ on the item being wound will increase by 0.2rad/s. If the spring speed on the item is ever lower than the axle speed, <em>the item will break/$. Items can only ever be wound with positive speed.
While an item is being wound in the <item>Spring Winding Stand/$, the <item>Stand/$ will produce <thing><link:intro/rotary>rotary power/$ against the current motion- actively slowing things down. It produces (or, if it makes more sense, loses) -20 * <thing>(spring speed of item)/$ J/t. Be careful when winding an item that you don't wind it so hard that the resistive power brings the machine speed down and destroys it!
<thing><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ will read the current <thing>spring speed/$ on the <em>item/$ being wound, not on the <item>Table/$ itself.

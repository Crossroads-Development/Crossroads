Stamp Mill
crossroads:stamp_mill
The <item>Stamp Mill/$ is the first stage in <thing>ore tripling/$- being a larger version of the <item><link:crossroads:rotary/millstone>millstone/$ that only handles ores. Axles & gears can connect to the sides of the base.
It takes in raw ores, and uses <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary power/$ to produce 3 <item>metal gravel/$. <item>metal gravel/$ can either be processed further in an <item><link:crossroads:rotary/blast>industrial blast furnace/$ or in an <item><link:crossroads:fluid/cleanser>ore cleanser/$.
Unlike most other machines, the <item>stamp mill/$ <em>will sometimes output unprocessed ore/$ instead. The <item>stamp mill/$ has <em>two/$ progress bars- a time based one, and a <thing>speed/$ based one. If the progress bar finishes first, the machine processes the ore properly and resets the timer. If the timer runs out before the progress bar finishes, the machine has a chance to succeed based on how full the progress bar is, or fails and spits out the unprocessed ore.
The progress bar fills up faster at higher <thing>speeds/$. At <thing>speeds/$ above 8rad/s, ore will be processed correctly every time. At a <thing>speed/$ of 5rad/s, it will succeed about half the time, and fail the other half- and so on.
<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Reader circuits/$ measure the fullness of the input.
It's your choice if you want to filter out the unprocessed ore and run it through again for better yields- or if you decide to increase the <thing>speed/$ instead.

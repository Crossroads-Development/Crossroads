Stamp Mill
crossroads:stamp_mill
The <item>Stamp Mill/$ is the first stage in <thing>ore tripling/$- being a larger version of the <item><link:crossroads:rotary/millstone>millstone/$ that only handles ores. Axles & gears can connect to the sides of the base.
It takes in ores, and uses <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary power/$ to produce 3 <item>metal gravel/$. <item>metal gravel/$ can either be processed further in an <item><link:crossroads:rotary/blast>industrial blast furnace/$ or in an <item><link:crossroads:fluid/cleanser>ore cleanser/$.
Unlike most other machines, the <item>stamp mill/$ <em>will sometimes output unprocessed ore/$ instead. The <item>stamp mill/$ has <em>two/$ progress bars- a time based one, and a <thing>speed/$ based one. If the timer runs out before the progress bar finishes, the machine spits out the unprocessed ore. If the progress bar finishes first, the machine processes the ore properly and resets the timer. If the machine runs out of time, the progress bar will carry over to the next crafting.
The progress bar fills up faster at higher <thing>speeds/$. At <thing>speeds/$ above 8rad/s, ore will be processed correctly every time. At a <thing>speed/$ of 5rad/s, it will succeed about half the time, and fail the other half- and so on.
It's your choice if you want to filter out the unprocessed ore and run it through again for better yields- or if you decide to increase the <thing>speed/$ instead.

The <item>Master Axis/$ is a core part of any <thing>rotary/$ network. Without one, gears, axles, and the like will not spin or transfer energy between each other.
Each network only needs one <item>master axis/$. Simple attach any gear or axle to the front face of the <item>master axis/$.
The <item>master axis/$ doesn't have any <thing>I value/$ or anything else like that- in early game it just exists to make everything work.
Later game, there are some <item><link:essentials:beam/crystal_axis>special master axes/$ with useful effects.

Welcome to Crossroads!
Crossroads is a mod about automation. Almost everything in the mod can be automated with the tools Crossroads adds, which are usually simple single-purpose tools that can be assembled into complex systems.
Rube Goldberg machines will be the simplest way to do things.
In this section of the book, you'll get a broad introduction to various systems in the mod- ideal for beginners. All the information in these entries are also in the respective guide categories, but it should be easiest to understand as a beginner from this section.
If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to join the <link:https://discord.gg/6g47knp>Discord/$, and if you find any bugs, please report them either on the <link:https://discord.gg/6g47knp>Discord/$ or <link:https://github.com/Da-Technomancer/Crossroads/>Github/$.
Crossroads has a lot of different energy systems and mechanics, and more will unlock as you get farther in the mod. If you're just beginning, I suggest you start with <link:intro/heat>Heat/$.
That concludes the introduct-

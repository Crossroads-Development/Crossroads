Most <thing>Technomancy/$ machines produce <thing>Temporal Entropy/$ instead of using power. <thing>Temporal Entropy/$ is a <em>reverse power system/$- instead of generators making power and machines using it, machines make <thing>Temporal Entropy/$ and 'generators' destroy it. If anything fills with <thing>Temporal Entropy/$, the machine will explode with disastrous effects. <em>DO NOT LET ANYTHING FILL WITH <thing>TEMPORAL ENTROPY!/$
<thing>Temporal Entropy/$ can be easily destroyed in an <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/sink>Entropy Sink/$, which requires being placed over a beacon. <thing>Temporal Entropy/$ can be transmitted using <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/node>Entropy Nodes/$.
Most <thing>Technomancy/$ machines and items require a material called <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/copshowium>Copshowium/$ to craft. It's worth getting a decent supply before starting.
A good first <thing>Technomancy/$ machine is the <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/beacon_harness>Beacon Harness/$, which produces massive amounts of <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beams/$ cheaply.

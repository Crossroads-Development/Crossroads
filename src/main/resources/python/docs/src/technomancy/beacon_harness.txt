Beacon Harness
crossroads:beacon_harness|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
The <item>Beacon Harness/$ is a powerful <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam/$ source, which produces <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>power/$ 512 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beams/$ of varying colors. It also produces <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ as a byproduct.
In order to work, the <item>beacon harness/$ must be placed <em>under/$ a beacon, with no air gap. It does not need to be touching the beacon block itself- it can be under the beacon base, and it will not interfere with the beacon running. It can also share the beacon with an <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/sink>entropy sink/$.
While running, the <item>beacon harness/$ will produce a beam of <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>power/$ 512- however, the color of the beam will continuously change in a simple pattern. If you look at a <item><link:crossroads:beam/chart>color chart/$, the color produced will follow the sequence of colors on the outer rim of the <item><link:crossroads:beam/chart>color chart/$, starting at red (pure <link:crossroads:beam/energy>energy/$) rotating clockwise (towards green). The time to make one full loop is 24 seconds (120 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>cycles/$).
This means that while running, the <item>beacon harness/$ will produce a mix of 2 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>primary alignments/$ (2 of <thing><link:crossroads:beam/energy>energy/$, <thing><link:crossroads:beam/potential>potential/$, and <thing><link:crossroads:beam/stability>stability/$). In order to run, the <item>beacon harness/$ <em>must be supplied with the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$<em> it isn't producing/$ (<thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>power/$ doesn't matter). Giving it a mixed beam will shut it down. This means that while producing a mix of <thing><link:crossroads:beam/energy>energy/$ and <thing><link:crossroads:beam/energy>potential/$, you must supply a beam of pure <thing><link:crossroads:beam/stability>stability/$. There is a <em>grace period/$ where you can supply the <item>beacon harness/$ with anything- or nothing- without it shutting down. This grace period lasts 1.6 seconds (8 cycles) every time the required incoming <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam/$ changes. Use this grace period as the switchover time for automated systems.
While running, the <item>beacon harness/$ produces 1 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ per tick.
The <item>beacon harness/$ is started (turned on) with a redstone signal (this can be a pulse). It takes 2 seconds (10 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>cycles/$) to startup.

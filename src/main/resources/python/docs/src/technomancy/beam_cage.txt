Beam Cage
crossroads:beam_cage|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
The <item>Beam Cage/$ is a way of storing <thing><link:intro/beam>beams/$ in an item- it acts as a 'battery' for <thing><link:intro/beam>beams/$. It can store 2048 each of <thing><link:intro/beam>Energy, Potential, Stability, and Void/$.
If a <item>beam cage/$ is put in a <item><link:beam/extractor>resonance extractor/$, the <item><link:beam/extractor>resonance extractor/$ will output the entire stored <thing><link:intro/beam>beam/$ at once. The empty <item>beam cage/$ will not be destroyed, and can be extracted by automation.
<item><link:technomancy/staff>Certain items/$ use the <item>beam cage/$ as a power source when the <item>beam cage/$ is in the offhand slot or in a baubles slot (if the Curios mod is installed).

<item>Beam cages/$ can be charged in a <item>Cage Charger/$, which is a block that can hold 1 <item>beam cage/$, and will store any received <thing><link:intro/beam>beam/$ in the <item>beam cage/$. <item><link:essentials/circuits>Circuits/$ measure the total <thing><link:intro/beam>power/$ stored in the <item>beam cage/$ if applicable. Automation can extract/insert <item>beam cages/$ from the <item>cage charger/$.

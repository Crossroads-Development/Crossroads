Copshowium

<item>Copshowium/$ is an important crafting ingredient in <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>Technomancy/$. Is is made using a <item>Copshowium Imbuer/$.

The <item>Copshowium Imbuer/$ makes <item>molten copshowium/$ using liquids and a <thing><link:crossroads:beam/time>time beam/$. Some (not all!) inputs also produce <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ as a byproduct (check the JEI). The produced <item>molten copshowium/$ can be made into <item>copshowium ingots/$ <item><link:crossroads:heat/fcc>the normal way/$.
The <item>copshowium imbuer/$ has a capacity of 10 ingots, and unlike most machines, can have the <item>molten copshowium/$ output overfill. If it does, <em>the machine will break/$. This is a bad thing.
It has two <item><link:crossroads:fluid/pipe>fluid pipe/$ connections- on the top and bottom. The bottom connection is for outputting <item>molten copshowium/$, and is extract only as expected. The top output is unusual- it can accept <em>and extract/$, and can do a fluid-sharing connection with <item><link:crossroads:fluid/pipe>fluid pipes/$. This allows regulating how full the input tank is, which is important for preventing the output from overflowing.
When hit by a <thing><link:crossroads:beam/time>time beam/$ (by default), any fluid in the input is converted into <item>molten copshowium/$ at the ratio set by the recipe for that fluid (check JEI for all the valid input fluids). This is when overflowing the output is possible.
If the recipe produces <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$, it will produce 4 per ingot of <item>molten copshowium/$ made.
<item><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ measure how full the <item>copshowium imbuer/$ is of the input fluid as a percentage, from 0 to 100.

<item>Copshowium/$ can also be used to make <item><link:crossroads:rotary/gear_base>gears/$, like any other metal. <item>Copshowium Gears/$ are special in that their <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>I value/$ <em>is zero/$.
This means that they do not require more <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>energy/$ to spin at a higher speed. A normal gear network using a normal <item><link:crossroads:rotary/axis>master axis/$ can not have a network of entirely zero mass (<item>copshowium/$ gears)- but can have some or most of the gears be zero mass. There is a <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/redstone_axis>special master axis/$ that can have only copshowium gears.

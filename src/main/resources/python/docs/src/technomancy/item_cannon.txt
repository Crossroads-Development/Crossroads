Item Cannon
crossroads:item_cannon|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
The <item>Item Cannon/$ launches items at almost any angle, and can send them huge distances (100+ blocks possible). The angle can be controlled and changed using <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>rotary input/$.
There are two <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>rotary inputs/$- one on the back, and one on the sides (any side other than the front or back). The back input controls the 'yaw' of the <item>beam cannon/$ (overall rotation firing angle), and the side input controls the 'pitch' of the <item>beam cannon/$ (firing angle from straight up/forward).
The pitch (firing angle from forward/up, in rad) will be the <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>speed/$ (in rad/s) of the side <link:essentials:intro/rotary><thing>rotary/$ input, with 0 being straight forward. The pitch is capped at ±π/2 rad (±90°) from straight. The yaw (overall rotation of the cannon in rad) will be the <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>speed/$ (in rad/s) of the back <link:essentials:intro/rotary><thing>rotary/$ input.
The pitch and yaw can be [un]locked by shift-right-clicking with a wrench, which will hold the pitch and yaw permanently constant at the current value, even if all the <link:essentials:intro/rotary><thing>rotary/$ attachments are removed. The pitch and yaw do not immediately change with the <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>speed/$- they re-orient into the new position, fairly quickly but not instantly.
While the <item>item cannon/$ has a redstone signal, it will launch any items in its inventory in the direction aimed. It can launch up to a full stack at once. The launch speed is the redstone signal strength (<thing><link:essentials/circuits>circuit/$ signals work) in blocks/tick, capped at 4 blocks/tick (equal to 80 blocks/second). A redstone pulse can be used to only fire once instead of running continuously.

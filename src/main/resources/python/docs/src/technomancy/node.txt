The <item>Entropy Node/$ is the main way to transfer <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$. They one-way transfer <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ wirelessly, and through walls.
Their outputs are set using a <item><link:essentials/linking_tool>linking tool/$. They have a range of 16 blocks, and can have up to 16 outputs each. Machines that produce <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ also have to be linked to the <item>node/$.
They transfer their entire storage of <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ every cycle split between all available outputs, and <em>can overfill connected machines/$. Remember, if anything overfills, it explodes! <item>Entropy nodes/$ have a <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ capacity of 64. This leads to an overall average maximum transfer rate of 64TEn/cycle.
Every time an <item>Entropy Node/$ transfers <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ (once per cycle when they have any), they increase the amount of <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ by 2. This means a long chain of <item>Entropy Nodes/$ will have more <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ coming out than went in, and may overload the <item>Entropy Nodes/$ at the end.

<item><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ read the current stored <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ or <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ throughput of the <item>node/$.
If a <item>node/$ has a redstone signal, it will stop accepting <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ (any <item>nodes/$ outputting into it will send <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ to their other connected outputs instead). They can still output <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ already in the <item>node/$ with a redstone signal, however.
<item><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ and redstone control allows making 'smart' routing systems for <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ that sends it along a different route- or stores it- when one <item>node/$ chain is almost full. For low overall <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ production, this isn't a concern- but for larger bases, this could be important.

Personal Time Rewinder
crossroads:recall_device|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
The <item>Personal Time Rewinder/$ is a handheld gadget which allows 'saving' a moment in time, and restoring yourself to it. Restoring a moment will move you back to the location, health, hunger, orientation, and momentum you saved (by default).
Save a moment by shift-right-clicking, and restore to a moment by right clicking. Only one moment can be saved at a time, and restoring a moment will save a new moment when you activate it.
Restoring a moment will cause temporal-whiplash in the form of nausea and possibly poison. The effect is more serious the longer ago the moment was saved.
By default, saved moments will expire if not used within 5 minutes. The <item>Personal Time Rewinder/$ must be wound up in a <item><link:essentials:rotary/winding_table>Spring Winding Stand/$ in order to be used. It uses 0.4 <link:essentials:rotary/winding_table><thing>spring speed/$ each use, and can be wound to a maximum of 10.

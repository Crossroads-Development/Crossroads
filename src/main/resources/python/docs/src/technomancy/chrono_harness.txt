Chrono-Harness

The <item>Chrono-Harness/$ is a way of producing Forge Energy that produce <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ as a byproduct.
It has no maximum FE power output, but produces 1 <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ for every 50FE produced (by default). As a result, producing more than 800FE/tick will create <thing><link:essentials:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ faster than it can be drained by <thing><link:essentials:technomancy/node>entropy nodes/$, causing it to inevitably explode.
It can be disabled by a redstone signal.

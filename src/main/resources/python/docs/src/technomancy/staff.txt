Beam Staff

The <item>Beam Staff/$ is a handheld tool that allows creating and shooting <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$ at blocks or entities on the fly.
The <item>beam staff/$ uses 4 hotkeys that are unbound by default. Make sure to go into keybinds and, under 'Crossroads', bind the 4 <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>primary alignment/$ control keys. There is one for <thing><link:essentials:beam/energy>energy/$, <thing><link:essentials:beam/potential>potential/$, <thing><link:essentials:beam/stability>stability/$, and <thing><link:essentials:beam/void>void/$.
While holding the <item>beam staff/$, the currently setting for what <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beam/$ it fires is shown in the top left of the screen. Pressing or holding any of the 4 <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>primary alignment/$ control keys will <em>increase/$ the setting for that <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>alignment/$, while holding shift while pressing the <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>primary alignment/$ control key will <em>decrease/$ the setting for that <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>alignment/$.
Right-clicking with the <item>beam staff/$ will fire a <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beam/$ of the set composition in the direction aimed. This beam has a range of 64 blocks. Holding down right-click will fire a continuous beam instead of a pulse.
The <item>beam staff/$ drains the fired <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$ from a <item><link:essentials:technomancy/cage>beam cage/$, which is required for the <item>staff/$ to work, and must be in either the offhand or a baubles slot (if Curios is installed).
The <item>beam staff/$ is also a decent melee weapon- it is, after all- a giant iron stick.

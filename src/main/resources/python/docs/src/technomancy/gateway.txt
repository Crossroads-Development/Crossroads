Gateway
crossroads:gateway_frame|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
<item>Gateway Frames/$ can be built into a multiblock <item>Gateway/$. The <item>gateway/$ is a portal that can connect to any other <item>gateway/$, including between dimensions. In order to connect to another <item>gateway/$, one of the <item>gateways/$ has to be dialed, and will produce <thing><link:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ as a byproduct.
The <item>gateway/$ multiblock is formed by building a vertical hollow square ring out of <item>gateway frame/$. The square must be an odd number of blocks long, at least 5x5 outside, one block depth, and the ring should have a width of (side length)/5 blocks (round down). So a 5x5, 7x7, or 9x9 ring has a 1 block thick ring, a 11x11 or 13x13 ring has a 2 block thick ring, etc. The multiblock is formed by right-clicking the top center block with a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$.

Each <item>gateway/$ has an 'address' of 4 <thing><link:intro/beam>alignments/$ that is unique to that <item>gateway/$. It can be checked with either an <item><link:intro/omnimeter>omnimeter/$ or <item><link:technomancy/goggles>modular goggles/$ with quartz. In order to link two <item>gateways/$- allowing teleportation between them- one of the <item>gateways/$ must dial the 'address' of the other.
A <item>gateway/$ is dialed using <thing><link:intro/beam>beams/$ and an <thing><link:intro/rotary>axle/$ connection on the top center block. The formed <item>gateway/$ multiblock has a large central 'dialing wheel' with 8 sides- each side is labeled with a different icon representing one of the <thing><link:intro/beam>beam alignments/$. The dialing wheel can be rotated by an <thing><link:intro/rotary>axle/$ connection on the top center block.
When the top center block of the <item>gateway/$ receives a <thing><link:intro/beam>beam/$ pulse, the currently selected <thing><link:intro/beam>alignment/$ will be dialed. The selected <thing><link:intro/beam>alignment/$ is the one on the section of the 'dialing wheel' at the top of the multiblock, under the giant pointer.
When the fourth <thing><link:intro/beam>alignment/$ is locked in, the <item>gateway/$ will link with the <item>gateway/$ with the dialed 'address', and the 'dialing wheel' will reset angle. This link lasts until a new 'address' is dialed.

The <item>gateway/$ that dialed the connection (not the receiving end!) will produce 1 <thing><link:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ per tick while connected. Both players and other entities can travel through <item>gateways/$.

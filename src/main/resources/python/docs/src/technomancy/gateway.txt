Gateway
crossroads:gateway_frame|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
<item>Gateway Edge/$ and a <item>Gateway Controller/$ can be built into a multiblock <item>Gateway/$. The <item>gateway/$ is a portal that can connect to any other <item>gateway/$, including between dimensions. In order to connect to another <item>gateway/$, one of the <item>gateways/$ has to be dialed, and will produce <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ as a byproduct.

The <item>gateway/$ multiblock is formed by building a vertical hollow square ring out of <item>gateway edge/$, with the top center block replaced with a <item>gateway controller/$. The square must be an odd number of blocks long, at least 5x5 outside, one block depth, and the ring should have a width of (side length)/5 blocks (round down). So a 5x5, 7x7, or 9x9 ring has a 1 block thick ring, a 11x11 or 13x13 ring has a 2 block thick ring, etc. The multiblock is formed by right-clicking the <item>gateway controller/$ with a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$.

Each <item>gateway/$ has an 'address' of 4 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ that is unique to that <item>gateway/$. It can be checked with either an <item><link:crossroads:intro/omnimeter>omnimeter/$ or <item><link:crossroads:technomancy/goggles>modular goggles/$ with quartz. In order to link two <item>gateways/$- allowing teleportation between them- one of the <item>gateways/$ must dial the 'address' of the other.
A <item>gateway/$ is dialed using <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beams/$ and an <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>axle/$ connection on the top center block. The formed <item>gateway/$ multiblock has a large central 'dialing wheel' with 8 sides- each side is labeled with a different icon representing one of the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam alignments/$.
When the <item>gateway controller/$ (top center block) receives a <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam/$ pulse, the currently selected <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$ will be dialed. The selected <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$ is the one on the section of the 'dialing wheel' at the top of the multiblock, under the giant pointer.
The dialing wheel will rotate to the angle in radians equal to the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>speed/$ of the attached <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>axle connection/$ on the top of the <item>controller/$. The angle of the wheel does not immediately move to match the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>speed/$- it will slowly rotate (at a rate of Ï€/2 rad/s, maximum time between two points being 2 seconds) to the correct angle. Every time one of the 4 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ is dialed in, the <thing>angle defined by each speed will change/$. After the first <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ is dialed in, the dialing wheel angle will be <thing>(axle speed)/$ - (speed when the first alignment was locked in) radians. After the second <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ is dialed in, it will be <thing>(axle speed)/$ - (speed when the second alignment was locked in) radians. And so on. After the final <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ is dialed in, the reference speed resets to 0, and angle=<thing>(axle speed)/$ again. The <item>gateway/$ itself has an <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>I value/$ of 0.
When the fourth <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$ is locked in, the <item>gateway/$ will link with the <item>gateway/$ with the dialed 'address', and the 'dialing wheel' will reset angle. This link lasts until a new 'address' is dialed.
The <item>gateway/$ that dialed the connection (not the receiving end!) will produce 1 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ per tick while connected. Both players and other entities can travel through <item>gateways/$.
<item><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ on any part of the <item>gateway/$ will measure the total number of locked in <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$.

Temporal Accelerator
crossroads:temporal_accelerator|crossroads:progress/path/technomancy
The <item>Temporal Accelerator/$ is a machine that speeds up time in a 5x5x5 area. It can affect blocks, entities, or both. It consumes a <thing><link:crossroads:beam/time>time beam/$ and produces <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ as a byproduct.
While holding a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$, the affected 5x5x5 area will be highlighted. Right-clicking the <item>temporal accelerator/$ will rotate it, and shift-right-clicking will change the mode between affecting only entities, only blocks, or both.
The <item>temporal accelerator/$ accepts a <thing><link:crossroads:beam/time>time beam/$ in the back. It will speed up time in the affected area by (<thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam power/$)/4 extra ticks per tick (or (<thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam power/$)*25%). While boosting time, <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ is produced- the amount produced grows exponentially with the applied boost- producing (2^(extra ticks)) * 2 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ per cycle (aka: +100% boost is 4TEn/cycle, +200% boost is 8TEn/cycle, +300% is 16TEn/cycle, etc.).
Multiple overlapping <item>temporal accelerators/$ stack additively. The <item>temporal accelerator/$ itself can not be time-accelerated.

The <item>Distributed Temporal Accelerator/$ is a larger-range version of the <item>Temporal Accelerator/$ that affects every tile entity in the entire chunk it is placed in. It <em>only affects tile entities/$, it does not apply to block ticks or entities.
It requires a stronger <thing><link:crossroads:beam/time>time beam/$ and produces more <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ than the normal <item>temporal accelerator/$, but is more efficient in terms of beam usage/entropy creation per block affected.
It uses a <thing><link:crossroads:beam/time>time beam/$ to create (<thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam power/$)/16 extra ticks per tick (or (<thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam power/$)*25%). It produces (2^(extra ticks)) * 8 <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>temporal entropy/$ per cycle (aka: +100% boost is 16TEn/cycle, +200% boost is 32TEn/cycle, +300% is 64TEn/cycle)

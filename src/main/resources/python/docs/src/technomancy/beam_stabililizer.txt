Clockwork Stabilizer

The <item>Clockwork Stabilizer/$ is a more advanced version of the <item><link:essentials:beam/stabilizer>quartz stabilizer/$ designed for use in high-<thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>power/$ centralized <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beam/$ systems.
It will store all received <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$, with a maximum storage of 320,000 <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>power/$. It will output 20% of all stored <link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$ out the front each <link:essentials:intro/beam>cycle/$, with the same color as the total stored <link:essentials:intro/beam>beam/$.
This has the effect of 'smoothing' out received <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$, turning pulses into continuous <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$ and reducing fluctuations in input.
<item><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ measure the total stored <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>power/$.

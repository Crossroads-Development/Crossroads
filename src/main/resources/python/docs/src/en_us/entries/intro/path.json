By this point you should have used <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/beam)beams/$.$(br2)<thing>Alchemy/$, <thing>Technomancy/$, and <thing>Bioengineering/$ are the three <thing>paths/$ you can spec into. By default (config controlled- may have been changed in your modpack), you can take every <thing>path/$ in singleplayer, but <em>can only pick one/$ <thing>path/$ in multiplayer.$(br2)If you can only take one <thing>path/$, pick carefully. A description of each <thing>path/$ is given below. When you unlock a <thing>path/$, you gain access to a huge number of new recipes, machines, and items. These recipes have to be made in a <item>Detailed Crafter/$, which is a special crafting table that can also craft <thing>path/$ specific recipes. In order to unlock any <thing>path/$, you <em>must/$ have discovered every <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/beam)alignment/$ (other than <thing>$(l:essentials:beam/void)void/$)- otherwise the <thing>path/$ will not unlock.$(br2)Every <thing>path/$ has specialities- things only it can do.

It adds a new crafting system based on chemical reactions. <thing>Alchemy/$ allows mass producing gems and metals, making special new super-dense materials that allow controlling gravity, doing terraforming and biome changing, and generally manipulating the forces of nature on a massive scale.$(br2)While <thing>Alchemy/$ is powerful, and probably the most straightforward <thing>path/$, it is also dangerous. Mix the wrong endgame chemicals, or spill something unusually dangerous, and you could wipe out your base and the surrounding landscape. It also takes longer to get the most powerful things in <thing>alchemy/$- parts of <thing>alchemy/$ are locked behind obtaining first the <item>Philosopher's Stone/$, and later the <item>Practitioner's Stone/$.$(br2)To unlock <thing>Alchemy/$, in a <item>detailed crafter/$, surround a glass bottle with paper after having discovered every non-<thing>$(l:essentials:beam/void)void/$ <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/beam)alignment/$.

Most machines in <thing>Technomancy/$ require having at least one nether star (but won't consume it).$(br2)To unlock <thing>Technomancy/$, in a <item>detailed crafter/$, surround a <item>$(l:essentials:rotary/gear_base)small gear/$ with paper after having discovered every non-<thing>$(l:essentials:beam/void)void/$ <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/beam)alignment/$.

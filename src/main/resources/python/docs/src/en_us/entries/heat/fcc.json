It requires temperatures below a certain threshold.$(br2)A typical recipe takes liquid, has a maximum temperature to work, and produces an item alongside heat. There is a <item>$(l:essentials:heat/cable)cable/$ connection on the top.$(br2)Any created heat will be released at a constant rate until all the created heat has been produced. For some fluids (like lava), this can be an effective heat source.$(br2)This machine is typically used for, among other things, producing ice or cooling molten metals into ingots.$(br2)"

As long as these conditions are met, it will produce a random amount of power based on the wind- anywhere between 5J/t and 25J/t, producing 15J/t on average. All wind turbines in the world produce the same power at any given moment. The only issue is that <em>the wind doesn't always blow the same direction/$. The direction the <item>wind turbine/$ tries to turn will randomly swap- which may mean it's fighting against energy stored in a rotary system due to momentum.$(br2)The <item>wind turbine/$ will also stop producing power at speeds above 2rad/s- the wind is never that fast.$(br2)The axle connection is on the back. The wool blades can be dyed individually by using dye on the <item>Wind Turbine/$ block. $(br2)"

Combining this with things like <item>$(l:essentials:rotary/gear_base)toggle gears & clutches/$ makes it possible to ensure your turbine is <em>never/$ fighting momentum. <em>This is probably a good idea!/$$(br2)"

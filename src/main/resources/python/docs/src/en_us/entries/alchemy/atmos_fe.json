			"text": "The <item>Atmospheric Attenuator/$ is a way of wirelessly transmitting FE globally and sharing it with other players. There is no range limit or FE loss. In order to function, there must be a pillar of 4 lightning rods (vanilla block) over the <item>atmospheric attenuator/$.$(br2)There is a global shared <thing>'atmospheric' storage/$ of FE with a (default) capacity of 1,000,000,000FE (1 billion FE). All players share the <thing>atmospheric FE/$, and there is no way of 'cutting off' other players from the shared <thing>atmosphere pool/$.$(br2)The <item>atmospheric attenuator/$ has two modes (toggle by shift-right-clicking with a <item>$(l:essentials/wrench)wrench/$) to charge the <thing>atmosphere/$ with FE or drain FE from the <thing>atmosphere/$. One <item>atmospheric attenuator/$ can drain/charge a maximum of 20,000FE/t.$(br2)However, if the <thing>atmospheric storage/$ gets too full, there will be global consequences. Above 50% full, lightning strikes will become more common, and can occur even during clear weather. Above 90% full, any creepers that spawn will spawn as charged creepers. <em>It would be a good idea to setup a system to prevent the charge from getting too high!/$$(br2)<thing>$(l:essentials/circuits#reader)Circuits/$ will measure the percentage fullness of the shared <thing>atmospheric storage/$ in FE. As the total storage is 1 billion FE, 500,000,000 is 50% full.$(br2)"

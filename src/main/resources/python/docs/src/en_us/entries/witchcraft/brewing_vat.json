It doesn't require blaze powder to brew potions, but uses <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/crossroads)heat/$ instead.$(br2)Like a brewing stand, it can brew three potions at once using 1 item ingredient. It can be much faster than a normal brewing stand.$(br2)It uses <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/heat)heat/$, and runs faster the closer it is to 125°C. If the temperature exceeds 125°C at all, it totally stops working but still consumes heat, so ideally it should be kept at just slightly below 125°C.$(br2)<thing>$(l:essentials/circuits)Circuits/$ measure the fullness of the three potion input slots, as a value from 0 to 15.$(br2)"

The efficiency is the same at all temperatures. There is a <item>$(l:essentials:heat/cable)heat cable/$ connection on the bottom, water/<thing>$(l:essentials:intro/fluid)distilled water/$ is piped in the sides, and <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/fluid)steam/$ comes out the top.$(br2)<item>Salt/$ produced as a byproduct of using regular water instead of <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/fluid)distilled water/$ can not be piped/hoppered out, and will clog up the <item>boiler/$ if not removed- using <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/fluid)distilled water/$ is therefore important for automation.$(br2)<thing>$(l:essentials:intro/fluid)Steam/$ can be used to generate power both as <item>$(l:essentials:heat/radiator)heat/$ or <item>$(l:essentials:rotary/turbine)rotary/$.

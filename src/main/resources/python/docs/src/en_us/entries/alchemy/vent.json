Any received <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/alchemy)reagents/$ will be released into the world at the <item>vent/$.$(br2)If multiple sets of <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/alchemy)reagents/$ are inserted within 1 second of each other, they will be combined before release. This is significant for things like the range of liquids/gasses, or for blending <thing>$(l:essentials:alchemy/effect)effects/$ for a flame cloud. As a <item>$(l:essentials:alchemy/conduit)conduit/$ can only transfer 5 units per tick, 1 second means it can group up to 100 units of <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/alchemy)reagents/$.$(br2)<item>Chemical vents/$ can handle <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/alchemy)reagents/$ that normally need to be contained in crystal safely.$(br2)"

One operation <em>always/$ takes 5 seconds, regardless of whether it has <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/rotary)rotary/$ power or not.$(br2)The created <item>centrifuged blood pouch/$ will gain <thing>$(l:essentials:witchcraft/cloning#degradation)degradation/$ based on the <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/rotary)rotary speed/$ while running. If it isn't powered at all, all the <thing>$(l:essentials:witchcraft/cloning#degradation)degradation/$ may make it totally useless.$(br2)While running, the <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/rotary)rotary speed/$ needs to be kept as close to the target speed as possible. The target speed starts at 0rad/s, and increases linearly while running up to 10rad/s, so the target speed being aimed for changes during the crafting operation. The spin direction doesn't matter (positive and negative speed are both fine).$(br2)The <thing>$(l:essentials:intro/rotary)rotary speed/$ doesn't need to be perfect, but the better it is, the less <thing>$(l:essentials:witchcraft/cloning#degradation)degradation/$.

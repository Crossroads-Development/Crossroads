Heat Sink

crossroads:heat_sink
The <item>Heat Sink/$ is a way of venting heat (or cold) rapidly.
They can be configured with a <link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$ to adjust the loss rate.
It will move the temperature towards the biome temperature at the set constant rate.

If the Create mod installed, the <item>heat sink/$ can be used as a heat source for the Create boiler, allowing using Crossroads heat to produce Create rotary power.
The strength of the heat sink as a boiler heat source depends on the heat sink temperature and on the loss rate. For 'warm' heat (like fire), needs to be above 50°C and draining at least 5°C/t. For 'burning' heat (like a blaze burner with fuel), needs to be above 100°C and draining at least 10°C/t. For 'blazing' heat (like a blaze burner with fuel and blaze cake), needs to be above 5000°C and draining at least 25°C/t.

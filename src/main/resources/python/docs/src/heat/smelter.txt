Smelter
crossroads:heating_chamber
The <item>Smelter/$ is a heat powered furnace, with a minimum temperature of 200°C. It has a constant heat drain while above 200°C, regardless of whether it is running.
It smelts faster at higher temperatures, but has a higher heat drain. The efficiency does not change. Even at the lowest working temperature, it is faster than a furnace.

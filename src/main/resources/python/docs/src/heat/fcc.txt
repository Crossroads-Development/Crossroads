Fluid Cooling Chamber

The <item>Fluid Cooling Chamber/$ is a crafting machine that converts liquids into items. It requires temperatures below a certain threshold.
A typical recipe takes liquid, has a maximum temperature to work, and produces an item alongside heat. There is a <item><link:crossroads:heat/cable>cable/$ connection on the top.
Any created heat will be released at a constant rate until all the created heat has been produced. For some fluids (like lava), this can be an effective heat source.
This machine is typically used for, among other things, producing ice or cooling molten metals into ingots.

Salt Reactor
crossroads:salt_reactor
The <item>Salt Reactor/$ is a way of cooling, <link:crossroads:heat/icebox>even below -20Â°C/$. It consumes <thing><link:crossroads:fluid/centrifuge>salt and distilled water/$ in a ratio of 200mB of distilled water per salt, while producing 200mB of normal water for every 200mB of distilled water. Every salt lasts for 20 ticks (10 redstone ticks, 1 second) as fuel.
The <item>Salt Reactor/$ can cool all the way down to <thing>absolute zero/$. <item><link:crossroads:heat/cable>Heat cables/$ connect to the bottom, pipes can connect to any side both to input distilled water and output water.

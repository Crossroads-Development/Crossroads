Radiator
crossroads:radiator
The <item>Radiator/$ is a way of producing heat using <thing><link:crossroads:fluid/steam>steam/$. <thing><link:crossroads:fluid/steam>Steam/$ goes in the bottom, <thing>distilled water/$ comes out the top, and <item><link:crossroads:heat/cable>cables/$ connect to the sides.
<thing>Distilled water/$ is produced in equal quantity of <thing><link:crossroads:fluid/steam>steam/$ consumed. The <thing>radiator/$ has no maximum temperature.

The because <thing><link:crossroads:fluid/steam>steam/$ is usually made <em>using/$ <thing>heat/$ in the same ratio as the <item>radiator/$ produces, the <item>radiator/$ is mainly useful for moving heat long distances, or for increasing the maximum reachable temperature- as <thing><link:crossroads:fluid/steam>steam/$ can be produced at as cold as 100Â°C, while the <item>radiator/$ has no maximum temperature.

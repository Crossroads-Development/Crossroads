Blood Centrifuge
crossroads:blood_centrifuge|crossroads:progress/path/witchcraft
The <item>blood centrifuge/$ is used as part of the <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning>cloning process/$, to turn <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood pouches/$ into <item>centrifuged blood pouches/$.
It can process two items at a time and takes a <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary/$ connection to the top. One operation <em>always/$ takes 5 seconds, regardless of whether it has <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary/$ power or not.
The created <item>centrifuged blood pouch/$ will gain <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#degradation>degradation/$ based on the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary speed/$ while running. If it isn't powered at all, all the <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#degradation>degradation/$ may make it totally useless.
While running, the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary speed/$ needs to be kept as close to the target speed as possible. The target speed starts at 0rad/s, and increases linearly while running up to 10rad/s, so the target speed being aimed for changes during the crafting operation. The spin direction doesn't matter (positive and negative speed are both fine).
The <thing><link:crossroads:intro/rotary>rotary speed/$ doesn't need to be perfect, but the better it is, the less <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#degradation>degradation/$. It is possible to have 0 <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#degradation>degradation/$ gain.
The created <item>centrifuged blood pouch/$ will <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>spoil/$ at the same time that the original <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood pouches/$ would have (the <item>blood centrifuge/$ doesn't reset the <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>spoilage/$ timer).
<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuits/$ read the current target speed, in rad/s.

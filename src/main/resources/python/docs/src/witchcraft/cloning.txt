Cloning
crossroads:mutagen|crossroads:progress/path/witchcraft
<thing>Cloning/$ is a major automatable production path in <thing><link:crossroads:intro/path#witchcraft>witchcraft/$ which allows cheaply mass-producing almost any mob (other than bosses, configurable), and creating custom-variants with buffs, debuffs, or special traits.
Potential applications for cloning include: Mass-production of rare mob drops, creating large numbers of super-strong tamed pets, creating better mounts, and more.
<page|text|traits>
The following special <thing>traits/$ can be given to clones:
<em>Respawning:/$ Respawning clones will respawn at full health in the same location, 30 seconds (config) after dying. They respawn with weakness, glowing, and <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/souls#transient>soul transience/$ for 30 seconds (config). If they die with <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/souls#transient>soul transience/$ they won't respawn, but can respawn an unlimited number of times other than that. They always give mob drops, even if they respawn- making them ideal for farming.
<em>Imprinting:/$ Imprinting clones will never despawn naturally. Also, if they're a tamable mob (ex. wolves or horses), they will spawn pre-tamed to the player who spawned them. If they were spawned by a machine (ex. dispenser), they won't be pre-tamed, but still won't despawn.
<em>Potions:/$ Clones can have permanent potion effects that will never expire, such as fire resistance or regeneration. This can include debuffs if you want to make them easier to kill.
<page|text|degradation>
All clones have <thing>degradation/$. A perfect clone will have 0 <thing>degradation/$, but errors or inefficiencies in the production process will cause clones to have <thing>degradation/$, reducing maximum health by 1 heart (configurable) for each point of <thing>degradation/$. Clones of clones will carry-over the <thing>degradation/$ from the previous iteration.
<page|text|process>
<thing>Cloning/$ starts with using a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe>syringe/$ to take a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood sample/$ from the mob being <thing>cloned/$. The <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood sample/$ will <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>spoil/$ if not used quickly enough, and using a <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>spoiled/$ <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood sample/$ causes 1 point of <thing>degradation/$.
The <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood sample/$ needs to be processed in a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/blood_centrifuge>blood centrifuge/$ to create a <item>centrifuged blood sample/$, which can also <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>spoil/$. If the <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/blood_centrifuge>blood centrifuge/$ setup is flawed, it can cause additional <thing>degradation/$.
The <item>centrifuged blood sample/$ is used to create the first <item>embryo/$. After the first <item>embryo/$ is created, it can be easily duplicated in a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cultivator_vat>nutrition vat/$ without needing more <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#blood>blood samples/$.
The first <item>embryo/$ is created in a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/embryo_lab>Miller-Urey capsule/$, where it can be customized to add <thing>traits/$.
<item>Embryos/$ <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>spoil/$ after 30minutes, and will be damaged by being <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>frozen/$, increasing <thing>degradation/$ by one point on them and any copied <item>embryos/$. Instead, they can be preserved using a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cultivator_vat>nutrition vat/$, where they can also be duplicated. <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>Spoiled/$ <item>embryos/$ are worthless, and can't be duplicated or turned into clones.
Finally, the <item>embryo/$ is made into a <item>spawn egg/$ for the final cloned mob, using an <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/incubator>incubator/$. These <item>spawn eggs/$ can be used by hand or by dispensers.

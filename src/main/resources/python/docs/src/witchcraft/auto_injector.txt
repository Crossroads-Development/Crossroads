Auto-Injector
crossroads:auto_injector|crossroads:progress/path/witchcraft
The <item>Auto-Injector/$ is a machine to automatically apply potion effects to mobs and players in an area. It is generally more reliable and efficient than splash potions in a dispensor.
It only works with potions which are non-instant (they have a duration). It stores one potion type, and can be refilled with any potion shape (normal, splash, or lingering). It stores potions in 'seconds', which are the number of seconds of the effect stored. It is more efficient with potions than drinking them normally, getting (by default, config controlled) 2x as much from the potion as was in the item.
The duration of the potion effect to apply can be changed by shift-right-clicking with a <item><link:essentials:essentials/wrench>wrench/$.
It affects a 5x5x5 area (rotate-able and viewable with a <item><link:essentials:essentials/wrench>wrench/$). It automatically applies to all entities and players in the area of affect, and is disabled with a redstone signal. It will re-apply the potion effect on entities when it is about to expire.
<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuits/$ measure the potion duration stored, in ticks.

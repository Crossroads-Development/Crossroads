Miller-Urey Capsule
crossroads:embryo_lab|crossroads:progress/path/witchcraft
The <item>Miller-Urey capsule/$ creates an <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#process>embryo/$ from a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/blood_centrifuge>centrifuged blood pouch/$, as part of the <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning>cloning process/$.
Ingredients have to be added to the <item>Miller-Urey capsule/$ using either a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#embryo_lab>syringe/$ or a dispenser. If adding items using a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#embryo_lab>syringe/$, hold the <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/syringe#embryo_lab>syringe/$ in the main hand and the item being added in the offhand, and right click.
The <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/blood_centrifuge>centrifuged blood pouch/$ must be added first- the <item>empty blood pouch/$ will be returned.
Additional items can be added to add special <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#traits>traits/$. Adding a potion will add the potion effect (returning the empty bottle), adding a nametag will add <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#traits>imprinting/$, and adding a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/souls>soul cluster/$ will add <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#traits>respawning/$.
To finalize the crafting, a lightning rod (the vanilla block) on top of the <item>Miller-Urey capsule/$ needs to be hit by lightning- any direct strike by lightning (such as a <thing><link:crossroads:beam/charge>charge beam/$) will work. This will consume all the ingredients and create one <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/spoilage>fresh/$ <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#process>embryo/$. If the <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/blood_centrifuge>centrifuged blood pouch/$ was originally spoiled, it will add 1 <thing><link:crossroads:witchcraft/cloning#degradation>degradation/$.
<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuits/$ read 1 if there is a <item><link:crossroads:witchcraft/blood_centrifuge>centrifuged blood pouch/$ in the machine, otherwise 0.

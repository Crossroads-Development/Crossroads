<item>Medicinal Mushrooms/$ are a farmable crop which has uses in brewing. They require darkness or mycelium, and spread to adjacent blocks like normal mushrooms. They spread <em>much faster/$ than normal mushrooms, and don't stop spreading when there's too many nearby (they can spread infinitely). They can not be grown into a giant mushroom.
There are four potion types which can be made with either the <item>medicinal mushroom/$ or <item>medicinal mushroom powder/$. Nausea, Blindness, Sedation, and Neutralization.

It does not work on players or boss monsters, but will instead apply flat debuffs.
<page|spotlight|neutralization|minecraft:potion{Potion:\"crossroads:curative\"}>
<thing>Neutralization/$ potions are milk in potion form. They remove all potion effects.

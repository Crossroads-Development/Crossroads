The <item>Formulation Vat/$ is a machine for producing several liquids used in bulk. It requires a liquid input and an item ingredient, which are used to make the liquid output.
It uses <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>heat/$, and runs faster the closer it is to 100°C. If the temperature exceeds 100°C at all, it totally stops working but still consumes heat, so ideally it should be kept at just slightly below 100°C.
<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuits/$ measure the fullness of the item input, as a value from 0 to 15.

crossroads:syringe
The <item>Syringe/$ can be used to apply potion effects more efficiently (or even make potions <em>permanent/$). It can also take blood samples.
To use the <item>syringe/$, it is held in the main hand while the item being used with it is held in the offhand. Right clicking or shift-right-clicking will target the entity you're looking at if there is one, otherwise it targets you.
Using a <item>syringe/$ does one point of damage to the target.
<page|spotlight|potions|crossroads:potion_extension>
Potions injected with a <item>syringe/$ are twice (by default; configurable) as effective. For potions with a duration, they last twice as long as it says on the bottle. For instant potions (ex. instant healing), they act as twice the normal level. As examples, Poison 1 for 30s will act as Poison 1 for 60s, and Instant Damage 2 will act as Instant Damage 4.
Potions with a duration can also be injected to last <em>permanently/$. This requires <item>Genetic Plasmids/$, which are made in the <item><link:essentials:witchcraft:incubator>incubator/$. To apply <item>genetic plasmids/$ to the <item>syringe/$, use the <item>syringe/$ with <link:essentials:witchcraft/spoilage>non-spoiled/$ <item>genetic plasmids/$ in the offhand, which will consume the <item>genetic plasmids/$. The next potion (with a duration) injected will last <em>forever/$, but be limited to power 1 (ex. trying to give yourself permanent regeneration 2 will give you permanent regeneration 1 instead; configurable). However, every permanent potion effect added this way will reduce the target's maximum health by 1 heart (by default, configurable).
Permanent potion effects and the associated decrease in maximum health can be removed with milk or a <link:essentials:witchcraft/medicinal_mushroom#neutralization>neutralization potion/$ as usual.
<item>Genetic plasmids/$ will <link:essentials:witchcraft/spoilage>spoil/$ after 30 minutes.
<page|spotlight|blood|crossroads:blood_sample_empty>
The <item>syringe/$ can also be used to create <item>blood samples/$. With an <item>Empty Blood Pouch/$ in an offhand, it will create a filled <item>Blood Pouch/$ based on the target. It will copy any permanent effects, traits, or deterioration of the mob into the blood sample.
Filled <item>Blood Pouches/$ will <link:essentials:witchcraft/spoilage>spoil/$ after 2 hours. <item>Empty Blood Pouches/$ can also be used by a dispenser to fill them from an entity.
<page|text|embryo_lab>
The <item>syringe/$ also has an interaction with the <item><link:essentials:witchcraft/embryo_lab>Life-Spark Capsule/$. See that entry for more details.

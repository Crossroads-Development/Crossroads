Several witchcraft ingredients will <thing>spoil/$ once a certain amount of time has passed since creation. <thing>Spoiled/$ items are less effective or useless. Items will continue to <thing>spoil/$ in unloaded chunks unless preserved.
There are several ways to prevent <thing>spoilage/$.
<page|spotlight|cold_storage|crossroads:cold_storage>
The <item>Freezer Box/$ stops items from <thing>spoiling/$ by keeping them cold. It has 18 slots. Every item that <thing>spoils/$ has a freezing temperature, below which it won't spoil. While the <item>Freezer Box/$ is below that temperature, the item won't deteriorate towards <thing>spoiling/$. <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>Heat cables/$ connect to any side. It loses 2Â°C/t for every item stored, moving towards the air temperature.
Certain items (like <item>embryos/$) are damaged by being frozen- freezing still prevents them from <thing>spoiling/$, but will make them worse in other ways. Those items can be preserved using the <item><link:essentials:witchcraft/spoilage#cultivator_vat>nutrition vat/$ without issue.
<thing><link:essentials/circuits>Circuits/$ read the average remaining lifetime of all stored items, in seconds before they spoil. Already spoiled items are measured as 0.
<page|spotlight|stasis_storage|crossroads:stasis_storage>
The <item>Stasis Box/$ stops items from <thing>spoiling/$ at no cost and without causing freezing damage. It only has 1 slot, and requires <thing><link:essentials:intro/path#technomancy>technomancy/$ to craft.
The <item>stasis box/$ is the only way to un-spoil items. A <thing><link:essentials:beam/time>time beam/$ will cause the stored item to re-wind the <thing>spoilage/$ timer, by (<thing>beam power/$ * 4) ticks per cycle. If the stored item has been <thing>spoiled/$ for a very long time, it may take a lot of rewinding.

There are certain items which <thing>spoil/$ but are damaged by freezing, such as <item>embryos/$. These items can be preserved without damaging them using a <thing><link:essentials:witchcraft/cultivator_vat>Nutrition Vat/$ which is stocked with <thing>nutrient solution/$.
See the <item><link:essentials:witchcraft/cultivator_vat>Nutrition Vat/$ page for more details.

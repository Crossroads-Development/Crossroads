<item>Soul Clusters/$ and <item>Soul Shards/$ are ingredients in several recipes. There are four <item>soul shards/$ in a <item>soul cluster/$.
Both <item>soul shards/$ and <item>soul clusters/$ are effective fuels, <link:essentials:heat/icebox>cold fuels/$ and <link:essentials:beam/extractor>beam fuels/$.
<item>Soul shards/$ can be produced using <thing>potions of soul transience/$.
<page|spotlight|transient|minecraft:potion{Potion:\"crossroads:transient\"}>
<thing>Soul Transience/$ potions are cause mobs to drop <item>soul shards/$ on death, if they die with the potion effect.
Villagers and Illagers drop 4 <item>soul shards/$ (one full <item>soul cluster/$ worth), living mobs will drop 2 <item>soul shards/$, and undead will drop 1 <item>soul shard/$. Players never drop <item>soul shards/$ from the potion.
Mobs (other than players) with <thing>respawning/$ will not respawn if they die with the <thing>soul transience/$ effect.
<thing>Potions of Soul Transience/$ are brewed using <item>soul clusters/$- so producing the first <item>soul cluster/$ will require a source other than the potion.
The <item><link:essentials:witchcraft/auto_injector>auto-injector/$ is helpful for automating soul production using <thing>Soul Transience/$.

TODO This page is a placeholder for a feature which is still being developed.
Summary: Preserves embryos using nutrient solution. Can duplicate embryos, possibly needing souls and/or mutagen based on stats. Circuits measure the remaining lifetime of the stored item, in seconds before they spoil.
There will be a <bobo>bobo/$ feature on this page, when it's added.

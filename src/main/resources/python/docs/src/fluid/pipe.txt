Fluid Tube
crossroads:fluid_tube
<item>Fluid Tubes/$ are the normal way to move fluids around. They have a capacity (and maximum transfer rate) of 2 buckets. <item>Fluid tubes/$ connect to any adjacent fluid inventory/machine/pipe/tank, and can transfer fluids between them.
<item>Fluid tubes/$ can be adjusted with a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$ on their connections to adjust the mode. Each connection has 4 modes: Input, Output, Locked, and Share. Input or Output modes only input/output fluid with a neighbor, Locked will be disconnected, and Share only applies to other pipes and <item><link:crossroads:fluid/tank>tanks/$ (including tanks from other mods). In Share mode, pipes will balance their contents to be the same % fullness.

There are also <item>redstone fluid tubes/$, which will only connect to/transfer with their neighbors at all while they have a redstone signal.

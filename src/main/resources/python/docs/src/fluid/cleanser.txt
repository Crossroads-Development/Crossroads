Ore Cleanser
crossroads:ore_cleanser
The <item>Ore Cleanser/$ is an <em>optional/$ processing stage for ore tripling. It uses <thing><link:crossroads:intro/fluid>steam/$ to convert <item>metal gravel/$ from a <item><link:crossroads:rotary/stamp>stamp mill/$ to produce <item>metal clumps/$ and <thing><link:crossroads:intro/fluid>dirty water/$ as a byproduct. By doing this, less coal/charcoal is consumed by the <item><link:crossroads:rotary/blast>blast furnace/$ to triple ores.
There is a fluid output on the top, and fluid inputs on the sides. Each operation consumes 250mB of <thing><link:crossroads:intro/fluid>steam/$ and produces 250mB of <thing><link:crossroads:intro/fluid>dirty water/$. This <thing><link:crossroads:intro/fluid>dirty water/$ can be reprocessed in an <item><link:crossroads:fluid/centrifuge>water centrifuge/$.

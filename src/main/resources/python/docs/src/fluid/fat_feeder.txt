Fat Feeder
crossroads:fat_feeder
The <item>Fat Feeder/$ uses <thing>liquid fat/$ (produced in a <item><link:fluid/fat_collector>fat collector/$) to feed nearby players and breed animals. It doesn't need any form of power.
Players in range will have their hunger and saturation restored to full (using 100mB of <thing>liquid fat/$ for one point of hunger or saturation). Nearby animals will be fed and put into breeding mode (using 200mB per animal). It will not breed animals if there are 64+ of them in range.
The range of the <item>fat feeder/$ goes up the closer it is to 50% full. The maximum range is 16 blocks, the minimum range (at 100% and 0% full) is 4 blocks. Unusually, <item><link:fluid/pipe>crossroads pipes/$ can do Share (bi-directional) connections with this machine, as if it were a tank. <em>This should make is easier to keep it at 50% full./$

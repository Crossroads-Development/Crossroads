Rotary Pump
crossroads:rotary_pump
The <item>Rotary Pump/$ is a <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>rotary/$ powered fluid pump. It collects fluid source blocks from the world, and allows it to be moved around in pipes.
It <em>only collects fluid sources directly underneath it/$. This means is it usually only useful for collecting water, and not for draining lakes or ponds.
It can also pump fluid from filled cauldrons. If it is a filled water cauldron, it <em>won't use the water/$ in the cauldron- allowing a compact infinite water source. This also works in the nether.
It connects to a gear or axle on the top. It runs faster at higher <thing>speeds/$, draining (2 * (speed in rad/s)) J/t, and requiring 100 J total per bucket pumped.

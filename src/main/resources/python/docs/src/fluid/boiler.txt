The <item>Steam Boiler/$ produces <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>steam/$ using <thing><link:essentials:intro/heat>heat/$ and water. It can also produce <item>salt/$ as a byproduct, but only if using water instead of <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$.
It has a minimum temperature of 100Â°C, but produces steam faster at higher temperatures. The efficiency is the same at all temperatures. There is a <item><link:essentials:heat/cable>heat cable/$ connection on the bottom, water/<thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$ is piped in the sides, and <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>steam/$ comes out the top.
<item>Salt/$ produced as a byproduct of using regular water instead of <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$ can not be piped/hoppered out, and will clog up the <item>boiler/$ if not removed- using <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$ is therefore important for automation.
<thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>Steam/$ can be used to generate power both as <item><link:essentials:heat/radiator>heat/$ or <item><link:essentials:rotary/turbine>rotary/$. Doing this will output <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$, regardless of what liquid was used to make the <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>steam/$. <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>Distilled water/$ can also be produced in a <item><link:essentials:fluid/centrifuge>water centrifuge/$.

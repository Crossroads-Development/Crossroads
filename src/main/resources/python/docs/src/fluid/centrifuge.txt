The <item>Water Centrifuge/$ produces <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$ and <item>salt/$ using normal water. It can also reprocess <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>dirty water/$ into <thing><link:essentials:intro/fluid>distilled water/$ and various different outputs (chosen randomly, see JEI).
There is a <link:essentials:intro/rotary>gear/axle/$ connection on the top. <item><link:essentials:fluid/pipe>Fluid pipes/$ can connect to any side.
In order to perform a crafting operation, it must have a <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>speed/$ of at least 0.5rad/s. Every time the <thing><link:essentials:intro/rotary>speed/$ reaches 0.5rad/s, it performs one operation, and <em>expects the gear to spin in the opposite direction/$ for the next batch. This means that to run, the attached gear/axle must <em>keep switching direction/$ every time it reaches 0.5rad/s. There is no limit on how fast the <item>water centrifuge/$ can run.
If either output (fluid or item) fills up, the <item>water centrifuge/$ will continue running. Any product that can't fit will be <em>voided/$.

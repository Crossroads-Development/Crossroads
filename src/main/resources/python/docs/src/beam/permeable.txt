Beam Permeable Blocks
crossroads:permeable_quartz
There are a few decorative blocks that are solid, but allow <thing><link:essentials:intro/beam>beams/$ to pass through them freely as if they were air.

<item>Permeable Quartz/$ looks like a block of pure quartz, but allows beams to pass through.

<item>Permeable Obsidian/$ looks like a block of obsidian and is blast resistant, but allows beams to pass through.

<item>Permeable Glass/$ allows light to pass through, and is transparent like normal glass. It does not look identical to normal glass, but allows beams to pass through.

<item>Light Clusters/$ are small, non-solid light sources that can float in mid air and that entities can pass through. Beams can pass through them, and they can be dyed colors by right-clicking with dyes (dye not consumed).

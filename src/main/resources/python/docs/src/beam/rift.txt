<thing>Rift/$ (purple) will spawn hostile mobs native to the biome. It has a <thing>power/$ / 256 chance to spawn a mob, with the chance capped at 1/4.
It can spawn mobs in solid blocks, and ignores the mob spawning cap.

<thing>Void-Rift/$ AKA <thing>Isolation/$ will prevent any hostile mob spawning nearby as long as the beam maintained. The range of this effect is the beam <thing>power/$, and requires the beam to be continuously maintained. Mobs can spawn while the beam isn't running.

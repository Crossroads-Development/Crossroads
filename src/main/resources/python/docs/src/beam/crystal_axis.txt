Crystal Master Axis
crossroads:master_axis_crystal
The <item>Crystal Master Axis/$ is an alternative version of the normal <item><link:crossroads:rotary/axis>master axis/$ used for gears. It would be used in place of the normal <item><link:crossroads:rotary/axis>master axis/$ (do not place both on the same system).
It accepts <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beams/$ from any side. The <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$ of the beam adds a special rule to the <item>crystal master axis/$ and all gears/axles it controls. The <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>beam/$ does not need to be continuously supplied- higher power beams will last for longer, with 1 point of power lasting 5 ticks (added every 5 ticks).
Only one <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$ can be active at a time, and the <thing><link:crossroads:beam/void>void/$ versions of the <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ can not be used.
<thing><link:essentials/circuits#reader>Circuits/$ measure the time remaining on the current <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignment/$.

The following effects exist (not all <thing><link:crossroads:intro/beam>alignments/$ have an effect):
<thing>Stability/$ will make there be no energy loss at all.
<thing>Energy/$ will add energy to the system every tick, in the direction that the system is already moving. (Amount controlled by config, default 100J/t)
<thing>Charge/$ will add energy to the system every tick, in the positive direction (even if the system is moving in the negative direction). (Amount controlled by config, default 100J/t)
<thing>Equilibrium/$ will reduce the change in the system's total energy each tick by a factor of 10. If a machine was going to consume 100J in a tick, only 10J would actually be consumed. On the other hand, if a turbine was going to make 100J, it would only make 10J. This has the effect of helping hold speeds steady and reducing fluctuations from the equilibrium speed.

<thing>Time/$ (orange) will increase the tick rate of tile entities by <thing>power/$ / 64 * 100%, as long as the beam is maintained. This is a maximum of double tick speed.
If applied to something that ticks randomly (like crops growing or ice melting), it will apply an extra random tick with a <thing>power/$ / 64 chance every 5 ticks.
This beam allows speeding up time by as much as double. While not very strong, there is a much stronger version later on in <thing><link:crossroads:intro/technomancy>Technomancy/$...

<thing>Void-Time/$ AKA <thing>Temporal Entropy/$ is EXTREMELY dangerous. DO NOT USE THIS! When you inevitably do anyway, don't say we didn't warn you...

Alignment: Potential-1
minecraft:emerald|crossroads:progress/alignment/potential
<thing>Potential/$ (green) is one of the basic <thing>alignments/$- the <thing>alignment/$ of a pure <thing>potential/$ beam.
<thing>Potential/$ acts as bonemeal, applied a number of times equal to the <thing>power/$ of the beam. In addition, it has an AOE heal, hitting entities within range=sqrt(<thing>power/$) and healing by <thing>power/$/2. Undead are harmed instead of healed.

<thing>Void-Potential/$ AKA <thing>Death/$ will kill plants, and harms living things within range=sqrt(<thing>power/$) by <thing>power/$/2. This ignores armor, and undead are healed instead of being harmed.

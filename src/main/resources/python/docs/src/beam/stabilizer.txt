Quartz Stabilizer
crossroads:quartz_stabilizer
The <item>Quartz Stabilizer/$ is a way of 'smoothing out' or 'spreading out' beam pulses. It accepts beams from all sides, and outputs on the front.
Unlike a <item><link:crossroads:beam/reflector>beam reflector/$, instead of emitting the entire input all together, it stores any beams sent into it and emits them slowly over time. The power of the emitted beam can be configured by shift-clicking with a <item><link:essentials/wrench>wrench/$.
This has the effect of spreading large beams out into a continuous beam of constant power.

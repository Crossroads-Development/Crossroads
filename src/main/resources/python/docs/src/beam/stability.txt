Alignment: Stability-1
minecraft:diamond|crossroads:progress/alignment/stability

<thing>Stability/$ (blue) is one of the basic <thing>alignments/$- the <thing>alignment/$ of a pure <thing>stability/$ beam.
<thing>Stabiliy/$ blocks all explosions within range while the beam is maintained. The range is the beam <thing>power/$. This includes some wither explosions and explosions from <thing>Chaos/$ beams- among all others.
Any explosions within the range will do no damage, destroy nothing, and will be completely stopped.

<thing>Void-Stability/$ AKA <thing>Chaos/$ will create explosions with a strength=<thing>power/$/4. These explosions will drop all items, similar to TNT explosions.

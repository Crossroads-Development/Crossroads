<thing>Enchantment/$ (light yellow) will enchant all items dropped in the world within range. They will be enchanted with a level equal to the beam <thing>power/$. If the beam <thing>power/$ >= 64, then it can get treasure enchantments (like Mending). The range is a radius of sqrt(<thing>power/$) / 2 blocks.
This beam is very powerful, as one shot can enchant an unlimited number of items with max level enchants, including treasure enchants.

<thing>Void-Enchantment/$ AKA <thing>Disenchantment/$ will disenchant all items dropped in the world within range. The range is a radius of sqrt(<thing>power/$) / 2 blocks. This can also remove curses from items.

crossroads:pure_quartz|crossroads:progress/alignment/enchantment
<thing>Enchantment/$ (light yellow) will enchant 1 item dropped in the world within range. They will be enchanted with a level equal to the beam <thing>power/$. If the beam <thing>power/$ >= 64, then it can get treasure enchantments (like Mending). The range is a radius of sqrt(<thing>power/$) / 2 blocks.
However, <em>any enchanted item has a chance to be destroyed/$. When an item is enchanted by this beam, there is a (power)% chance to destroy the item. For example, a power 15 beam has a 15% chance to destroy the enchanted item. This can be disabled in the config.
This beam is very powerful, as one shot can enchant an items with max level enchants, including treasure enchants, without costing XP.

<thing>Void-Enchantment/$ AKA <thing>Disenchantment/$ will disenchant all items dropped in the world within range. The range is a radius of sqrt(<thing>power/$) / 2 blocks. This can also remove curses from items.

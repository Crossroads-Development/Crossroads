<thing>Fusion/$ (light teal) has no 'effect'- but there are several useful block conversions <thing>fusion/$ can do- such as making prismarine from gravel and <item><link:fluid/ingr>pure quartz blocks/$ from sand.

<thing>Void-Fusion/$ AKA <thing>Fission/$ also has no 'effect', but can reverse the block conversions from <thing>fusion/$ beams.

Alignment: Equilibrium-1
crossroads:pure_quartz|crossroads:progress/alignment/equilibrium
<thing>Equilibrium/$ (pink) blocks all explosions within range while the beam is maintained. The range is the beam <thing>power/$. This includes wither explosions and explosions from <thing>Chaos/$ beams- among all others.
Any explosions within the range will do no damage, destroy nothing, and will be completely stopped.

<thing>Void-Equilibrium/$ AKA <thing>Cataclysm/$ will cause any explosions within range to repeat continuously as long as the beam is maintained. The radius is the beam <thing>power/$.
Any explosion in range will repeat- with the same location, power, and traits- every 4 ticks while the beam is running. This does include wither explosions and extremely large <thing>Chaos/$ beam explosions.
If a <thing>Cataclysm/$ and <thing>Equilibrium/$ beam apply to the same explosion, the <thing>Equilibrium/$ beam wins.
It is difficult to overstate how devastating and power a non-stop massive <thing>Chaos/$ explosion can be.

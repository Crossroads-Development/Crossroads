Alignment: Expansion-1
crossroads:pure_quartz|crossroads:progress/alignment/expansion
<thing>Expansion/$ (teal) will place any items in the world in range as blocks- if they have a block form. The range is a radius of sqrt(<thing>power/$) / 2 (cap 4). This is one of the only ways in Crossroads to place blocks in the world.

<thing>Void-Expansion/$ AKA <thing>Contraction/$ will break whatever block it hits and drop it as an item.

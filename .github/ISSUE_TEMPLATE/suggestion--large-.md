**Scope**
How big is this suggestion? It is a new UI button, a new machine, a new mechanic, or something else?

**Suggestion**
What is your idea? Give as much detail as possible, but try to keep it organized.

**Justification**
Why do you want this? Sales pitch goes here.

**Impact**
How will this affect the mod? Will it change the balance, tamper with progression, change the theme or aesthetic, add an entirely new branch of mechanics, or something else? It's OK if the answer to some of these questions is 'yes'- change can be good.
